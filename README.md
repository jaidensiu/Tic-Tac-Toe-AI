# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI

What I learned and what I can further learn:

- Pygame which is basically a Python GUI for creating video games
- How to implement a simple AI using the Minimax algorithm
- Alpha-beta pruning can be used to decrease the number of nodes that are evaulated by the minimax algorithm in the search tree

Notes:

- Run ```python runner.py``` to play with the intelligent system
- For Python 3.11, type ```pip install pygame --pre``` to install Pygame
